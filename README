Music player was constructed using this tutorial:
https://youtu.be/Zf_psaJ-wP4

*Used at the bottom of the page
*JS functions are very similar, html & css needed to be changed as the tutorial
is based off of an app structure whereas I needed it for a website structure. 

JS code for filtering was taken and altered from Rocco's classes on filtering in js.

!!!!
The music player for some reason doesn't work on the github.io page however if you download 
the full project and use a live preview (opened in a browser) it will work perfectly.
